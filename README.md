VADER is a sentiment classifier that returns the intensity of emotion on a -1 (most negative) to 1 (most positive) scale. It is a rule-based model that calculates sentiment scores and takes into consideration intensifiers, capitalization, punctuation like exclamation marks, and contrastive effects of words like "but." The VADER model works well with informal short text. A drawback is that the classifier was developed in 2014 so the emotion expressions may be outdated.
