07/31/2024,"My husband and I sat at one of the booth and there were three other couples in their 60s or 70s eating lunch yesterday at around 2 o’clock when we were there. there was a mother that came in with what appeared to be her mother and two little boys about 2 1/2 and five sitting at another one of the booths. those two little boys especially the younger one were little demons. they yelled at the top of their lungs through our entire meal and the younger one was actually standing on the table at one point and jumping up and down on the seats of the booth most of the rest of the time. all of the other couples were getting really irate and I did talk to our server but he couldn’t say anything. my problem with this is nothing was said to the mother and grandmother with the two extremely unruly behaved boys because it might hurt her feelings or you might lose a customer. By Not saying anything you ruined a nice quiet meal for four other couples who may not come back because nobody would tell the lady to discipline her children or ask her to leave. I know this is quite the conundrum, but my husband and I were looking forward to a nice relaxing meal out and we couldn’t get out of that restaurant fast enough.. it was everything but relaxing, it was extremely stressful.",None

06/15/2024,"It was an absolute disaster trying to pay our bill last night. We told the server from the start that we were two checks- it didn't happen. They also put two drinks on our friends bill and she only had one. The bill was combined and it was a ridiculous process to get it straightened out. What should have been a 5 minute checkout turned into 45 minutes for us to pay &leave. Husband paid on the QR code and we were notified by Amex that it processed only to be told that it did not by the server. They tried to put it on us that we didnt tell them- yes we did.  By the end, I was pretty mad. I didnt need to be told several times by the manager ""i understand"" when I was asking why it was taking so long and the bill trying to be sorted out and entered in your system correctly. I let my husband deal with it. There are too many places in this town to eat who manage to get the bill correct the first time. This isnt the first time we or our friends  have had bill issues there. Typically it is a quick fix but last night was beyond ridiculous. Currently we have THREE pending payments from last night. This is unacceptable.",None

Secondly, I ordered gin martini and was shocked when I received the bill of $18 per drink. This is significantly more than I have paid for same drink at any local establishment…or had any establishment I have ever dined. 

I was going to raise the issue with the bar tender, but suspect she was just charging what she had been told to charge.

I suggest you revisit your price structure on this product. I will never order it again here, and I will be sure to check prices for mixed drinks before ordering here in future. I feel I have been taken advantage here, and left very bad taste in my mouth.",None

Being a big burger would be an understatement, it was outright large, large enough where it was hard to bite into. Michele has the Fish & Chips, 2 pieces of Atlantic Cod hand dipped in their Smithwick’s beer batter, with homemade tartar sauce, coleslaw, and fries. This was the first time I had one of their burgers, but rest assured it will not be the last burger I get there. We were both very happy with our choice and both left with a full belly.",None

Improvements: I’m not sure if it’s already an option because I just recently signed up for the rewards program, but having a physical rewards card or a way for the server to scan the app barcode at the table while taking payments would be more convenient than having to give the server the phone so they can go scan the barcode from the app then come back and continue taking payments. It would be even more convenient if the creator of the app could update it so members could scan their own receipt. It’s not a big deal either way, just a slight “convenience improvement.”",None

I love their meatloaf and it is the one item which made me able to order meatloaf at restaurants, but having had meatloaf at home recently, I decided to order another favorite from the menu, and that was the Bacon Bourbon Chicken. A good choice it was, it was delicious with the mashed potatoes covered with the bacon bourbon sauce and a side of mac and cheese, which was also delicious. The service was great (thank you Bob), the food was great, and the place was clean. Those three things are what makes me add a restaurant to my favorite list of dining options.",None

Also, charging a “service fee” (for what?) and also $1.50 for ranch dressing for my kids to dip their chicken strips is a bit absurd. We’ve never had that before and we were pretty displeased to see those two charges on our bill. In an age where it’s already a luxury to eat out at any restaurant because of skyrocketing prices, let’s not nickel and dime the consumer even more. Build the price of that ONE dipping sauce into the kids meal price for crying out loud. Even Wendy’s does that. It makes your establishment look cheap and classless.",None

07/16/2023,"We arrived at 3pm on purpose to avoid crowds to celebrate my husband's 77th birthday (party of 6).  With all of the many choices of beer, he was disappointed Crosstown didn't have Genesee Cream Ale.  But the manager on duty was so kind & generous with his time to explain why. My husband pointed to the Genesee Cream Ale sign on the wall and let him know he was interested in buying it, but they didn't come up with a price.  And since my husband is a Retired US Marine & Vietnam Vet with 3 Purple Hearts, we inquired about a military discount.  And the manager politely responded with ""I'm sorry, we don't."" We did sign up for the Rewards Program as suggested by our nephew who was in our party.  He and his family are very frequent customers and LOVE Crosstown.  So we'll be able to enjoy those discounts on our return visits.

However, this was our first visit to Crosstown, and we'll definitely be returning.  And we're anxious to try Maquire's since we reside in Sharpsburg.

It took a while for the food to be cooked, which was fine, it was trivia night (which we weren’t aware of before getting there). I ordered cottage pie and when it came out I noticed it was very soupy and didn’t have the ritz crackers on top. As I started to eat it I realized the liquid was just I undrained grease from the meat. It took a while for someone to check on us and my husband and son were already done eating. And my husband and I both needed refills. The server who came and checked on us asked if I would like my food remade. I asked how long it would take and she said about 5 minutes so I told her that would be ok. She came back and said that the ritz crackers were left off because they were out of them. It took well over 5 mins to get my food and I immediately asked for a to-go box which took even longer to get. Paying took another long length of time. Very disappointing experience.",None

Also, we had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated, but not due to full tables. Instead, they said the kitchen was backed up. Obviously, you need more help.",None

We had a 2 year old grandchild with us.  Wifi DOESN’T work.  Not a pleasant meal cause we had to keep her busy for a long time.  

Please fix Wifi.  When the wait is long, Wifi helps to entertain children. Also have a single server do such a large group.  Lack of help is very evident.

01/23/2023,"Although Senoia isn’t close to us, for nearly 15yrs it’s been worth the extra miles - even to introduce family & friends to the authentic, delicious food. Last few years, there’s been less of both of these: the giradelli cookies are not from scratch, fish size was reduced & almost brown crust not like usual golden. 
  Today, the chicken “pot pie” wasn’t a pie but a small, shallow dish with larger chunks of 3 potatoes & dry/old-tasting chicken, a few carrots, peas, 2-tbsp? of gravy and 2-pieces of pre-made dough strips across center the dish. It took about 30-40 minutes after our order. In the past, the food would have been worth the wait. The 2 servers tried to keep up with the lunch crowd but could have used help. The ambiance of an Irish restaurant ready to provide an authentic Irish dining experience has not been our experience at Maguire’s lately. The food used to remind me of Moms cooking or eating in Ireland. We understand prices going up, but not the lack of adherence to Irish cooking for which Maguires used to be known. Thank you.",None

The manager offered to make something else or give us a dessert. 
We stood inside for a minute or two waiting on the hostess to get us on the list. This has been an issue the last several times we’ve been.

We enjoyed all of the them.  My husband had the delicious French onion soup, outstanding chicken pot pie and I thoroughly enjoyed the fish and chips.  I also got the delicious bread pudding and took it home to savor it with my Sunday morning coffee.
We so enjoyed the location (downstairs), I immediately thought of the pub on ""Cheers""  and the quaintness of the pub.  I have never been to Ireland but we definitely want to go, especially now after visiting this establishment. Savannah and the whole staff made us feel like we were old friends.

We’ve spent a lot of money here over the past year or so and have been rooting for the business to do well and stay afloat through clearly tough times, but when the kitchen can’t even fully cook chicken (our most recent visit) it’s not only an unpleasant experience dining out but also a health risk. The recipes are good, the staff is always generally friendly, and it’s the only restaurant of its kind in the general area.

The bar Tendor doesn’t put off a warm vibe and basically looks like she is on burn out mode and doesn’t like her job. Last couple of visits I have made both my friends said the samething that we felt we was disturbing her to place a food order or get another drink.

08/11/2022,"The staff was very nice.  We got our food quickly.  It tasted great.  The problem I have is not with the restaurant, but with your rewards program.  I have not been able to redeem any points since I started.  The app will not pull up in the restaurant. I had my number written down on a card so the server could pull it up, but she put my charge card in before she put in the rewards number so I could not redeem any points.

08/08/2022,"1 - The food was good, but my order of a medium rare steak was overcooked a bit.  My wife enjoyed her burger very much.

2 - When we seated ourselves and saw the scanning bar, we debated whether to leave or not.  Thankfully, Hannah brought us menus and allowed us to  have a nondigital dining experience.  I did not even bring a telephone in the restaurant, and I would never take one out while dining.  I hope you will not convert to an impersonal digital format.

3 - I ordered a Black Russian cocktail and was charged $6 for Vodka - I did not order any special vodka -  and $8 for the Black Russian (I assume this was a charge for Kahlua).  I found that unusual to be charged for the ingredients separately.

I hope the feedback helps.",None

08/03/2022,"I truly enjoy your Cobb salad with the grilled chicken or salmon.  Also your burger with the avocados and bacon is very good.  They are some of the best of the restaurants in this area.

Please do not start to change them to save on costs.  One of my pet peeves is when a restaurant starts to lower the quality or reduce the portions to save money.......thinking customers will not notice.  (one of my former favorite restaurants recently has been doing both.  I went there for many, many years, however they have permanently lost me as a customer.)  

Also, Kirsten does an awesome job!  She needs a raise.

I had the salmon burger for the first time. About halfway through it I found what look to be a piece of plastic approximately an inch long.

My husband ordered hamburger cooked medium with Swiss cheese and bacon only. My mom ordered a burger cooked medium well with lettuce and tomato only. What came out was husbands burger with bacon , lettuce, lettuce, tomato, and pickle no cheese and cooked rare. My moms came out plain no lettuce or tomato and well done. When our waitress came through to ask how it was we did tell her that my husband’s hamburger was undercooked and my miles was over cooked however we didn’t have time for them to redo them since we had to be somewhere shortly. I had grilled salmon with lemon pepper but the seasoning was mostly salt and that was all I could taste. Our iced teas had very little ice. My kids sprites were so big that they were hard to maneuver with tiny hands. We did inquire with the waitress about smaller cups, and she told us that they did have smaller cups but they did not have lids. I’m not sure if that’s a supply chain issue or not, but these adult size cups for kids are very hard to manage for tiny hands. We will probably come back, but it won’t be anytime soon.",None

She never came back to check on the food or see if we needed drink refills, which we desperately did. After 15+ minutes , we were able to flag down a random worker and asked him to please bring us some refills.

I recommend any and all truly Irish recipes, perhaps add more Irish faire. I would NOT recommend foods of other types, like burritos.

But I would like to say - I really miss your good vegetables! Last several times I've gone - they are non existent. You used to have excellent brussel sprouts but they're never there anymore & the broccoli was very limp & watery - not fresh. Also the other only choices were green beans (which none of tried so I don't know how they were) & that zucchini mix which wasn't great last time I went - just meh) So after spending over $100 + tip I wish you had better vegetables again. And I know you can get them - because I get them at the grocery all the time.

My suggestion would be to marinate/season the steaks. It also took forever to order using the app at the table and really wish you would go back to servers taking orders.

12/13/2021,"We visit Crosstown Grill often. However, our last visit was not what we expected. Ordering food and drinks from an app was so impersonal. Our waiter (lack of one) came to our table to introduce himself and never returned to check on our food or if we wanted more drinks. We had to ask for our bar drinks. The food was just okay. It usually is pretty good. Fish and chips were very bready, fish tacos had barely any cod filet on it and the French onion soup was bland (needed seasoning or salt). Overall, our experience was not a great one, and we’ll wait till the restaurant has better service with more wait staff. I want to be honest with this survey because we like eating at your restaurant.",None

This was certainly not your fault, but it seems there was no backup plan for this situation, and a single waitress was having to take orders and run food for every table.  Also, the restaurant was under a boil water advisory with tea, lemonade, fruit punch, and milk being the only beverage choices, but this was not told to us prior to our order being taken.  Again, this was not your fault, but you could have at least offered the beverages for free, given the limited choices.  Lastly, we noticed you got an 80 on your last health inspection.  I expect a quality restaurant like yours to never get a score lower than 90.  I hope you have made the corrections necessary to improve your score next time.",None

11/14/2021,"The food was great.  However the cocktail content has gone down, 
when there is Jameson whiskey you should be able to have at least a taste of the whiskey or feel it warm your throat a bit as it goes down. Also short glass of bloody Irish was less than 3/4 full. Now that we have to scan and order our own food it takes awhile to get everyone's order so it will all be in one ticket. The manager on duty (slighty large tall woman)was fake courteous, borderline condescending and rude, when assisting as your new online menu is not the same as hard menu.  Crosstown has been reduced to nice food and building but fast food style restaurant.  I am glad it wasn't changed when I was there 2 weeks previously when I arranged our office lunch or we would not have stayed.",None

When we questioned this, the server said the price had gone up, but they hadn't gotten around to changing the menus yet.

09/08/2021,Food was a little off tonight but still a lovely dinner experience with my family. The Ruben spring rolls were not as good - I’m not sure what the difference was. My son’s chopped steak was a little hard - I’m not sure but maybe over cooked? Not complaining - we still love it there - just not as great as usual. I have always loved how you have nice vegetables (Brussels & spinach) but lately seems more just brocali & squash as the choices - maybe just the night I’ve been there. Thanks though - I know it’s difficult for a lot of places lately.,None

09/03/2021,"The waiter was very friendly and attentive most of the time.
The steak cuts we all ordered were nice quality meat.
The salad mix in our salads was fresh and green.
My husband loved the Line Creek Brewery beer on tap.
I hated that both of our tables on the patio were wobbly. Why are tables always wobbly? A restaurant should consider that an important part of dining (not spilling your drinks!) whether inside or out and ensure their tables are stable every day when they clean them.
My meat was undercooked and the waiter should have told the chef before bringing it out to me and leaving it with me until I realized it and then I had to go inside and find him and ask him to have my meat cooked a little more.
I would like to see the fries served hot because they cool off quickly.
I would like to see a side salad served before the meal so the meal doesn't cool off while I'm eating my salad.
Every restaurant makes a different side salad and therefore, waiters should go over the ingredients when one is ordered in case someone doesn't like onions or croutons or cheese. I would have liked to have onions and croutons left off my salad, but I didn't know to tell him.
I would like to see the waiters trained better on their new ordering devices before they come to the table to take orders.",None

My husband and I both had our favorite bourbon chicken, but it pretty much was bland.  It was our first time bringing our daughter and her husband as they live out of town.

05/10/2021,"I've been a patron of the pub and Crosstown for many years.  I know Wendy (from MaGuires) and have met Frank, if they are still the owners.  I used Maguires for many business functions (Winpak) and also used Crosstown a few times for business functions and they always did a very nice quality job.  The food was always good.  Hence, I was very disappointed with the Mother's Day dinner buffet.  It just was not an impressive buffet at all.  Also, although food was in the warming pans, it was cold.  The dinner buffet started early, 2PM I think, and we came in at 5PM.  The buffet tables, pans, and serving area just weren't kept up in terms of cleaning.  You know how food spills are frequent on buffets and it requires effort to keep the serving pan handles and table surfaces clean.  A little of this issue is to be expected, but there was a lot of this when we where there.  Also, meatloaf, roast beef, mac & cheese, salmon, etc. are just not good when they are cold.",None

04/08/2021,"I do not know which visit this survey is for . . . If it was for Sunday, March 28, at Crosstown, it was a very poor experience due to inebriated customers sitting near us at the bar.  Their loud obnoxious filthy language would be enough to keep us from ever returning.  Shayna behind bar said this was pretty much their normal behavior; perhaps a bartender should be a bit more in control of bar customers.  We have been frequent customers, but based on our last visit, this may change.  Also, your wine pours have been drastically reduced in the past several visits, especially during happy hour.  When you have to purchase two glasses to equal a decent wine pour, it is no bargain.  I'd love to go back to only complaining when you didn't have brussel sprouts!

02/23/2020,"Actually, I visited the Crosstown Grill twice in the past week. The first time I was ever there was 20 Feb when I took my wife there for our 30th Anniversary. I liked it so much, I took a good friend there just yesterday (Saturday). I used my the pub card both times so it may seem like I visited the pub instead. Both were great visits. I liked the food. I think the Bourbon Bacon chicken is the best thing on the menu (although the mashed potatoes weren't very hot). I love the selection of draft beers. My wife loved her sangria. The server and manager werer great, but no one did anything special to recognize the anniversary. On Saturday, I enjoyed the daily happy hour. I always wanted to try the fish and chips. The fish was very good although it could have been a little more generous with the fries. Also, I wished there was more than one craft beer selection for the happy hour. I tried the Steak  Quesadilla as the appetizer. It was a real winner.",None

02/01/2020,"Looks as if some decisions were recently made to reduce the size of the drinking glasses and a poor decision to offer these ""environmental superior straws"". That is, I hope a temporary decision as those straws are horrible. When you give patrons a smaller glass size, you set your wait staff up for failure by increasing their workload and increase the chance that a guest will be... out of drink before the staff realizes it and can refill it. The straws just plain out are a bad decision, I used three straws that night myself, you actually increased the landfill usage and the customers don't like them. I suggest if you want to increase your customers experience, give them a larger glass and offer a plastic or paper straw, let the customer decide what they want.

After our meal, I went to the restroom and our waiter, Keenan, was complaining to another employee very loudly about the tip that was left. We left 15% on both checks at that table. Also, that is more than what was deserved considering he forgot our drinks, never came back for refills, and he didn’t do much of anything else for us. Very disappointed in the service.",None

However, the bus boy came over and started clearing our table before we were finished and even stacked my husband’s cup inside his empty one without even asking if he was done, which he wasn’t. There were several empty tables at that point and no one waiting on a table. There was no reason to try to rush us.",None

01/02/2020,We had stopped coming to Maguires for awhile because of a couple menu changes. They took my wife’s favorite Alfredo and bangers off and stopped putting chili in the Irish nachos. We came back a few nights ago and I was happy to see that the nachos were changed back to include chili. Now it would be nice if the chili wasn’t all at the bottom of the dish under the kettle chips. We wish the Alfredo and bangers would be brought back now. It would also be nice to have some rotating specials brought back like there used to be.,None

12/24/2019,I’ve always loved eating at maguires since you opened.  The paper straws are a little ridiculous.  Kids need about 7 of them to complete their drink. Straws won’t save the world.  We aren’t near an ocean.,None
12/24/2019,"The cod fish was excellent as always, but your fries could definitely stand improvement. Then tend to be cold and limpy. They appear to be a poor quality of frozen fries. The slaw and tartar sauce were good. Service was very good even though you were extremely crowded while we were there. Good teamwork between management and servers was evident. I'd like to see you have better draft specials than what you do now. I remember when you used to have draft beers $2 each. A nice selection of draft beer for $2 can bring in more business and increase sales. Adding a few better wines to your selection for sale by the bottle would also be a nice addition.",None

08/09/2019,"We disliked more than we liked. The server forgot to put our entree order in. When we brought it to his attention, it still took quite a while to be served and even then our ""fish 'n chips"" were very undercooked. The replacement showed up at our table very quickly with some of the breading still not cooked. The oil was simply too hot, and the preparations were hurried through. My wife, who has 21 years experience in the food industry, discussed the issue with the manager who in turn, comped the entree. This was a very nice gesture on her part. We were not looking for a ""freebie"" but merely offered some constructive criticism so that, hopefully, the situation will be resolved.

The hostess was rude when we requested to be seated in a booth (which there were plenty, it was not busy at all). Our waitress was excellent. My fish and chips was inedible and was sent back due to the fact. There was hardly any fish, mostly breading that was undercooked and doughy.

But it appears that no one is checking the food before it's brought to the table. The girls in our party ordered the Irish Chicken. The mashed potatoes on both orders were cold. When we notified the server Jennifer, all she said was, ""Sorry about that"", but didn't offer to bring hot potatoes or reheat the meals. The girls asked for a little more gravy for their meal and we got charged extra. We asked for another cup of pretzels while we drank and waited for our dinners, and got charged extra for those too. It's not the money. It's that silly ""pretzel and a half per person at the table"" rule.

It said Wednesday was Trivia Night. It wasn't. When we told the greeter it was on the website, she said she knew. They just hadn't taken it off yet. Also, I never knew the pub had a wifi password before. I'd post it on a sign. The Irish chicken was very good, although I though the food could have been hotter with some more of the mashed potatoes.

12/15/2018,"CiCi was an awesome server! We had a great time as always, and the food quality is always top shelf. One suggestion on the Rueben Sandwiches (which two of us ordered): (1) Cut the corned beef up into smaller slices before making the sandwich. It's hard to eat when you bite into the sandwich, and all of the meat comes out because they are long pieces of corned beef.
(2) The sandwich needed more sauerkraut (it was very minimal)
(3) Needed more thousand island dressing
(4) Needed swiss cheese (there was none on the sandwich)",None

09/16/2018,"The best server we had was the one we had last night. All the other servers from past visits were fine, so no complaints there. I have to say the food is horrible. I'm speaking as three people...my daughter, wife and myself. We have tried various items over the past year and few months. Try the onion rings at Ted's. They are much better. Yours are heavy with oil and it seemed the oil in the fryer needed to be changed. They also had a rancid taste. The club sandwich I ordered looked great in appearance, but was tasteless for the most part. It just tasted salty. The turkey and ham seemed to be a lower quality meat. Aside from looking pretty it was one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had. The coleslaw should come in a larger container. The tiny plastic cups are way undersized...a joke actually. You have two great locations...Maguires in Senoia and Crosstown in Peachtree City. I wish the food was better. Please understand I'm not having a bad day and using this survey to grouse about something. We kept coming back and leaving disappointed. This is just my/our opinion. We may be in the minority, but this is how we feel. Do not bother to add points for taking this survey. Last night was our final visit, so we won't need them-even for a free dinner.",None

The first time I thought he was just having a bad night so I let it go. Last night same thing. He is grumpy and not engaging with his tables. Refilling seems to be a burden. He was not like this with just us. It appeared as all of his tables were experiencing the same mood.",None

04/02/2018,"Upon being seated I showed the server my Crosstown (discount?) Card for which I had paid $30.  He took the card.  When he came back I ordered a Samuel Adams beer which was listed on the ""drinks menu"" at $3.00.  He brought me the beer in a GLASS.  I asked why he did not provide a (larger) mug which, as I understand the discount program, I was supposed to et at the same price as a (smaller) glass of beer.  I paid the bill I received.  BUT, when I got home and looked at the bill he charged me $12 for two mugs of the Sam dams beer.  As I understand the program he should have charged me $6.
The program is confusing - to me, the customer, and clearly to your servers (as I have had similar ""problems"" in the past.
The next question asks if you can ""use"" my comments -- I REALLY DONT think you will.
I would appreciate getting a brochure or some other paper showing what I AM entitled to with your ""discount"" card.

03/21/2018,"The Irish Chicken Breast is my favorite on the menu. Never disappoints. The chicken and mashed potato portion is generous. The leek sauce is incredible, I always ask for extra. It's well worth the charge. The broccoli was nice and firm. Just right. We brought along a friend and he ordered the Fish & Chips. Honestly, it's never been my favorite. But this time, I thought it was much improved. The onion rings were also very good. I had the Harp, it was excellent. We ate at the bar. The atmosphere is great. The charm of an Irish pub with a fun mood. My only comment is the bartender/server didn't offer us the the signature pretzels with mustard sauce and my family hasn't received any of the nice birthday/anniversary coupons like we have in the past, but it's OK.

This last time we were really disappointed in the beer ""specials"" and the downgrade in the house wine.  Bud Light at $3.50 is not a special, and the other choices were clearly beers that needed to be unloaded...they were horrible  Natty Light, really???.  Please consider bringing back at least one decent beer at a decent price (Yuengling, for instance?) to keep the happy hour folks happy and spending money in your establishment.  :)  No good beer specials = us not stopping by for happy hour = us not ordering appetizers and/or a meal = Crosstown losing business.

I always get the chicken Alfredo adding mushrooms with a side Caeser salad, mussels and my hubby gets the fish and chips. This time my hubby changed up the fish and chips to the Cajun burger and he LOVED IT! However most importantly the staff is AHHHHHMAZING and they treat to as a friend or family NOT as a customer and we love that. Stephanie usually is our waitress and she is excellent. Recently we had Laura as our waitress and she was just as great as Laura. Lastly I'm picky when it comes to my drinks but I'm a women so what do you expect. Ha!  I don't like to taste the alcohol to much in my drinks and the blonde bartender is excellent. She makes my sangria perfect ALWAYS!!! She always recommends the best IPA beer for my hubby to. Typically that's unheard of. If I had to suggest something to change I would suggest that you guys NEVER change your hospitality or the way you do business. Lastly keep Alex in your management, he is just as amazing as the rest of the staff. Hopefully we'll see you guys Friday night and if not y'all have a very Merry Christmas!",None

We have been in love with it ever since. The food is amazing, my husband always gets the fish & chips along with a different kind of IPA beer each time. While I'm not a beer person I rather have sweet drinks. I would always get your green cocktail (2-3 of them) along with the chicken Alfredo adding mushrooms. However this past Friday I tried a new drink, it was a Sangria. I loved it!!! So far no matter what IPA my husband gets or what drink I get (the green drink or sangria) they always go great with the mussels! Which are amazing as well. We have also tried the sausage bangers before & they where good but the mussels are our favorite so far. While we are sure our kids would love the pub as much as we do we selfishly have kept the pub our little secret for now. The only thing I would change is making it mandatory not to remove the green drink or sangria from the menu.",None

Both delicious; I made short work of mine and gave the wife some help with hers. Of course we had the bread pudding...scrumptious!

My suggestion is that the front door staff be more attentive to departing handicap guests who may need assistance. While it is no problem for me it may be for others.

07/29/2017,"I asked our server and hostess about my 78 rewards points and what they can be used for and neither could tell me, however they both suggested I might get an email for a coupon on my birthday, but not positive about that. Suggestion would be to train your staff about the rewards program and how it works because I still do not know.  I do recall something about getting emails from time to time when I signed up, but that has not happened.  Do you send out emails from time to time? It would be good if you did do that, reminders about you establishment would be good to get.

Many tourists come to senioa and would probably recommed this restaurant just based off the pretzels and awesome mustard sauce.

I have had rehearsal dinner and birthday parties in the wine celkar area. I have been coming every Wednesday since Trivia sarted there to support your place and Shane.  We use to use Theo as our server and he was amazing and when he vouldnt be there Heather.  After Theo left we consistantly use Heather.  Now i know she has another job but told us she would stay at Maguires for us on Wednesdays.  Now she is no longer working.  The service has declined greatly since Heater left or hasnt been there or scheduled.  Foid quality has been going down for over a uear.  Prices going up pirtion sizes getting smaller and foid not as goid as it use to be.  Bad service and foid are not the way to kedp people coming there.  We have a table of usually 10 to 20 pwiple every week.  The only reason we come now is to support Shane.  Almost everyones orders were messed up last week.  Our server didnt tell the mansger but my husband did tell the manager as we left.  We are seriously talking about finding somewhere else to go and do trivia. That would be 10 to 2p vustomers every Wednesday thst would not be there and I dont see a waiting list on Wednesdays waiting for us to leave.  Senpua has many other restraints in town as do PTC and Newnan that people can go to.  That put group can go to.  All of us wznt Heather back on Wednesdays!  We all want the food portions and quality to go back up or we wont come back and word of mouth spreafs.  If we each yold three people of our negative things anout Maguires that is 60 customers we can impact and if they each told three it multiplues up quickly.  We also are not the pnly large groups or for that fact smsll groups or familues thst gave noticed and are upset about the service and food quality.

Ordered chips with burger; came with fries (but server brought chips and let us keep the fries which someone else in our party enjoyed a few of).  Wish happy hour could be extended just a bit!  We rushed to get there by 6:00 but arrived at 6:04 and seated at 6:06 (per your clock at the bar) so we missed out on half off house wine.,None

05/16/2017,"Our visit to Crosstown Grill on Mother's Day was not quite up to the generally great standard we get from the the pub restaurants. First the breakfast buffet ran out just as we were ordering with close to 2 hours left till the 'end of the buffet'. It was slight disappointing, then I ordered a Reuben sandwich in which the taste was a bit off. The manager came out and comped the sandwich and made it right. I understand things happen and the buffet rush was a little unanticipated, and we will definitely keep visiting both Crosstown Grill and Maguires, just giving feedback on our visit.",None

The chicken pot pie was wonderful as always and a southwestern burger and onion rings were very good, but needed more seasoning or jalapeños for my taste. The food and drinks came out in a timely manner given the crowd that day. We will continue to eat here whenever we are in Senoia.",None

We ordered two things that were not even available.  Raspberry lemonade and spinach dip.  It took forever to get our food in general and the kids were starving.  The orders were wrong, so we had to ask for two items to be corrected.  We were underwhelmed with the food.  I know that's just an opinion, but I normally love the green beans and they were hard and less tasty.  I was just disappointed, but that doesn't mean we won't be back.",None

I said fine, bring me the bowl that it usually comes with and i usually pay for.  Lying about extra being put in the dish was ridiculous, it was obvious that NO extra gravy was in it.  
We also asked for pretzels and mustard and when she came out again without the pretzels we inquired about it and were told because of high volumes you were not serving them.  A few minutes later an order of soft pretzels with mustard was brought to our table.

At that point I had lost my appetite so an hour into our visit the food arrived.  Needless to say, I did not touch my food and asked for a box for it to go.  My family ate their dinner but overall none of us were happy with our experience last night.  When told that our order was ""EXPEDITED"", we expected that... especially knowing that all it was were 2 fish and chips and  chicken strips  and fries!!!  Deep fryer food!!!

10/11/2016,"The service provided by the waitress was awesome, the overall rating of ""Fair"" is the result of the very poor service that was dished out by the host/Maitre D. We arrived around 7:00 PM to a quiet, approximately 40-50% capacity dining room, the bar area was marginally occupied.
The host confirmed our party had 3 adults and we were immediately told ""It will be 10-15 minutes"". When I asked why the wait, she acted as if we were interrupting her day and said ""we actually have a party of 15 coming and you will have to wait"". With several booths and tables vacant my family and I felt we were not important enough for her to at least invite us to the bar for drinks or at least admit ""We don't have our act together and cannot seat more than 50% of the capacity of our restaurant on Mondays"". Whether the kitchen staff, the wait staff, the runners, or bar staff were understaffed, communicating that to us and actually serving us would have gone a long way. When we finally got seated I asked the host to ask the manager over. She either ignored that request (fear that the manager would find out what a crappy attitude she had) or the manager didn't give a poop enough to come over.  The waitress saved the day and was awesome. I explained to her the way we were treated, she did explain this to the manager and he did come over. We had a free round of drinks that I would have gladly paid for (probably $20 of lost revenue), and of course the food was top notch. If I were a first time visitor, that would have been my last time. I have probably been to the pub and CrossTown Grille dozens of times and will come back and expect that this was an isolated poor hiring decision. I certainly believe that proper training is key and if she was properly trained, she may best be suited for a job ""in back"".

However this time, on August 22, my fish was luke warm and the roasted red potatoes were overcooked and seemed as though they were heated up from an earlier batch. My husband said that his fish tacos were bland. We joined the rewards club and received our coupon for a free appetizer. We chose the spinach dip. It was good but it was also lukewarm. I figured that it was the time of the day, around 4pm, that was the issue. I am a manager at Atlanta Bread in PTC, so I am really understanding when it comes to shift change and such.

The whole purpose of the stem is to avoid having your warm fingers increase the temperature of the wine. I understand stemless glasses are trendy and easier to store; however, I prefer a glass with a stem. On my last visit, when I ordered my wine, I specifically requested a glass with a stem. The waitress still brought me a stemless glass. Again, it's not a big deal, but since you asked....",None

There were hardly any customers, so this was totally inexcusable!  Only after I complained to the bartender/my server did he go get the manager.  He told me he had gone back 3 times to check on my food.  (I saw him.) The manager had seen me sitting there, and I had introduced myself to him several visits ago.  I don't know what problem was going on in the kitchen.  The manager did apologize.  This was a disappointing visit.  It was around 5 p.m. on a Saturday.  I had ordered the same menu item ""to go"" for my husband.  It was brought out much quicker.  Hope this is addressed, as I love your restaurants.",None

My husband and I sat for at least 15 mins without having a server come over to ask if we even wanted a beverage.  The bartender (whose name we found out to be Ben) came over as he noticed we were just sitting there and asked if anyone was helping us.  After we told him no, he was nice enough to take our order and became our server for the evening ...and a great one at that.  He was very attentive pleasant and accomodating.  He is the reason why I can say our dining experience was an excellent one!!!!!!!! The Fish & Chips and calamari sticks were delicious as always, in fact that is the reason we dined there that night.

Although there were a lot of people there on Sunday, it was not as crowed as it is on Wednesday night.

Our favorite things are the Irish Nachos, Salmon Cakes, and Corned Beef. That dish might be served with a side of brown mustard, since we always have to ask for one. 
My only critique is that all the menus were worn out and dirty last night. Could be a fluke, but perhaps it's time to print some new ones?",None
05/16/2016,"-Food is always fresh and tasty and predictably good, meaning consistency from visit to visit, which I appreciate. The same menu item doesn't change depending on who in the kitchen is preparing it.
-Love the selection of beers at relatively good pricing for a restaurant.
-The restaurant was relatively empty for a late Saturday lunch, but it took quite a bit of time to get salads, burgers and sandwiches. What I tell my fiends about the Crosstown Grille is the food is quite good but you'll wait for it. Wait what you think is a normal amount of time and then add 5 or 10 minutes.
-The wait staff's manners should be improved. ""No problem"" should be replaced by ""My pleasure."" Send them to Chick-Fil-A for some training.
-Please consider increasing portion size of salads. I know you use quality ingredients but a quarter of a small avocado is only two bites. The portions on sandwiches are oversized but salads seem a little skimpy.
-Please consider decreasing upcharges when making substitutions. $4 to add sweet potato fries. That is the charge to buy them outright. And sweet potatoes and white potatoes are not that different plus many people like sweeties so this will not be an unusual request.",None

05/15/2016,"We went on Saturday and Sunday last week. On both visits we saw people leave because they were dissatisfied. On Saturday it took our server a long time to get to our table but he was very nice and took good care of us. On Sunday we had a long wait more than the 20 minutes we were told, there is no place to sit and wait outside. When we went back inside to sit when a bench came open we noticed a couple seat themselves at the bar that is on the right side. They must have been regulars, the server in there greeted them and took their order right away. We asked the hostess if the bar area was open for dining and she said yes, we went to take a seat and the server ran us out and fussed loudly at the hostess in front of us and others. (Will remember her and NEVER sit in her section). My husband wanted to order the bagels & lox but kitchen had run out of salmon. Another family wanted the roast beef and kitchen had run out. They left. It was a large party and very sad to see because they had brought Mother's Day gift. Both visit for us were good because of the servers and the food.

The only thing off was the coffee - tasted old, burned and stale.  It is usually not good.  I don't know if it sits around all day before they serve it or if you just use a brand of coffee that is bad.  But that's a pretty minor flaw in an otherwise perfect meal.  And our server was very professional.  We were a big group and the game made it difficult for her to get our order.",None

You would think that on a day that you anticipate high volume you would have enough food to keep the restaurant running. My family upset for me because I let them choose where to take me for a late lunch and then we get there and everything is unavailable. Our waiter was great though and made it enjoyable.",None

05/09/2016,"Service time is slow.  We sat for about 5 minutes before anyone even came to get our drink order.  I ordered green beans as my side, and while they were fine, they were cold and there weren't many of them, which was disappointing.  Also not very flavorful, some garlic would've made a world of difference.  The upcharge for ordering a side rather than fries with a meal is a little much.",None

05/05/2016,"My visit yesterday was fine.  I tried the fish tacos.  They were a little spicier than I personally like, but otherwise they were fine.  One of my dining companions, however, ordered the mussels.  He had to have a second order delivered, as more than half the mussels on the first order were not opened.  My food last week, however, was probably the worst I've had at your restaurant.  I ordered the chicken pasta alfredo.  The sauce was like glue.  There was way too much cheese on it, and when you tried to pick up some of the pasta, you got a big glob of pasta with a gluey mess.",None

Seating was a major negative factor on our experience.  I was taking my wife out to lunch and we were seated in a booth that was nice but next to a rowdy bunch of people who were very loud and enjoying themselves at the expense of everyone within 10 feet of them!  You were ""filling"" available seating within a convenient space for your service at the expense of our personal dining experience!  The food did not make up for the discomfort we felt during our lunch.  
Not that long ago, we were seated at another restaurant and the staff immediately recognized that the party at the adjoining table were loud and making life uncomfortable for those around them.  Without asking, they moved us to another quiet room!
I should have asked for the same from you!  However, I get the impression that you cater to loud and rowdy!  We are probably not people you want attending your establishment!",None

Tonight our waitress was overwhelmed serving a large table (the draft table) as well as at least 3 other tables.  We waited quite a while before our order was taken.  Then my husband got his food first and was finished before myself and my 2 kids were even served our food.  Refills were few and far between.  The waitress was working hard to do the best that she could with the amount of people she was serving.  Again, we understand it was a busy time, but the service was just not what we were used to receiving at your establishment.  On the positive side, the food was very tasty.",None

The Irish Chicken on the menu is a best kept secret. It's incredible, especially because of the sauce. The only thing I would note for room for improvement is when the staff are distracted. When we came in Maquire's the staff at the front seemed more interested in something else instead of greeting a customer. First impressions are important. Often people entering a restaurant don't know what to expect. A freindly smile and a warm hello goes a long way. The greeters should make an extra ffort to make the people just coming in feel welcome and not ignored. I also ordered a drink and noticed when the server was bringing it to my table, he stopped to have a conversation with another employee. Customers can notice things like this. Overall though, another great experience.",None

It was overcooked (which I understand happens when you order anything more than medium).  The guacamole served on the side was brown.  The iceberg lettuce under the burger (I ordered no bun) had brown spots.  The kettle chips were not fresh and kinda cold and chewy.  My husband ordered the Irish Dip and said it was adequate  - nothing to write home about.  We love Maguires and will be back, but I've noticed every once in a while the quality goes downhill and then rebounds to the same great standards we've gotten used to.  Two suggestions...cool that beer a little more, and put the Buffalo Blue back on the menu.  :)",None

I am always pleased with the food, service, and atmosphere, but lately it seems to have taken a big slide.  Mainly with the service.  Last night after being seated by the host, we sat about 10 minutes before we signaled someone down to get a menu.  after taking our order and waiting at least another 15 minutes, we finally signaled her down to get some pretzels. I understand we were at one of small 2 seater tables in front of the bar and it was busy Friday night, but if you aren't going to get decent service there, then don't offer it.  This was the 2nd time this lousy of service was provided to us.  I understand busy Friday nights, but after SEVERAL times this has happened at the bar & other locations in McQuires, I think the waitresses are really understaffed, sending the ones you have in a frenzy and not being able to give the great quality & friendly service we go to McGurire's for.  Please taken my comment into consideration, we have many couples not wanting to meet us there anymore because of the declining service and we love the friendliness and local feel you have always provided.

We then asked the manager and she said they have asked him before and he won't turn it down.

06/08/2015,"We like the location and atmosphere. We were among the first to visit and had some odd not so good things happen the first few visits. We eat out more than once a week and very much wanted to add Crosstown Grille as one of our regular spots. First visit they forgot to put our order in and apparently forgot we were there, they were still training servers and we waited over 2 hours for food. Second visit they were out of water. Third visit order was placed incorrectly but a very nice manager made amends in a way that made us change our mind about NEVER coming back. Our forth visit was great. Food has been good at all visits. This last visit the table was dirty when we were seated. The host who seated us just wiped part of it when asked and pushed the crumbs into the seat. The pretzels brought out were in a jar that had visible sticky purple stuff around the rim and All the pretzels had been broken. Also one of the napkins was dirty. Kind of surprised but we were in a hurry that day and just let it go. We have recommended Crosstown Grille to others. Two that we know tried it and thought it was fine. One is vegan and thought the veggie burger was okay but not great. We will probably try again but still has not made it one of our go to on a regular basis. We purchased a discount card from local school baseball team and we very much believe in supporting businesses that support the community plus we like a discounts coupons and reward programs because we eat out often and frequently having one or the other incentives is a deciding factor for us.

After 4 or 5 years of coming to the pub, you would think that they would have an 'off night' or something, but they are consistently good.

05/23/2015,"Three of the people with me last night ordered the corned beef. Two of them got the last two cuts off the brisket which were very thick, chewy and salty. The other person got cuts from a new brisket and his cuts were 2/3 fat. He sent it back and the new plate he got was exactly the same. It seems that whenever Frank is not there in the kitchen the kitchen staff is very lax in being able to provide the quality of food we have come to expect at the pub. In addition, the expeditor is not doing his/her job. Those plates should have never been brought to the table, especially the one with all the fat. It seems like they don't care. The last few times we've been in with our friends there have been problems with the food, either temperature wise or with the food not being cooked as requested. We hope you correct this problem soon because we love the pub and we don't want to see you lose business because of the kitchen staff and expeditor's inability to do what needs to be done. By the way, our server Lindsey was AWESOME! And last week when we were in Jose' was awesome too.",None

Jose was very attentive & charming, great server to which we hope we get again.  Only improvement is the bench had a nail sticking up, it could snag some ones clothing.

Waitress advised that a different order was unavailable and substitute order was taken; 5 minutes later she advised that the original item was avaialble.

I ordered the meat loaf with mash potato and we waited about 40 minutes for our meals and when they finally came our food was not very hot and the meat loaf had a really strong garlic taste.  If this had been our first visit, in which it was for our friends that were with us, we would never return again.  I didn't send my order back because it took so long to get our first meals that I didn't want to make our company have to wait for another one.  The banger and mash was cold tasting also and the chicken pot pie looked like it had been made earlier in the day.  It will be a while before we make the trek from Stockbridge/Rockdale county line all the way over to Senoia for a meal again. There are too many restaurants between here and there that have good service and great food.  After coming to Maquire's quite a few times, not sure if it's the place for us anymore.

01/27/2015,"My husband and I frequently come to your restaurant and sit at your bar. We absolutely love the restaurant, the food and the majority of your staff-- In particular: Karen, Mariah and Heather. They always make for a great experience! However, last night when we came to the bar, our bartender, I believe her name was Tori, was serving us (Or at least she was the person behind the bar). We sat down and waited and waited as she chit-chatted with some other guests -- which is fine, we like being on the other end of that chitter-chatter, however, enough time went by to where another employee noticed we didn't have drinks yet and got them for us. We didn’t even receive a glance from the bartender until my husband ran out of his beer and she came over to ask what he would like next. Each time we needed another drink or to order food we felt like we needed a flag in order to get her attention and we felt like we were bothering her when we did get her attention. After about 10 minutes of sitting with both of our beer glasses empty we were ready to head out and once again were trying to flag down our bartender but once again that same employee that took our first drink order jumped into action and got our check to us. (I regret not getting her name because she was wonderful and so very sweet to us). We were just very un-impressed by the bartender last night. Karen and Mariah always go around to all the guests at the bar and at the very least say “hello” and ask “how are you doing”. I can’t say that we received a “hello”, a “how are you doing” or even a question on whether we enjoyed our dinner from our bartender last night.  We love your restaurant and the people there but you may want to rethink who you put behind the bar. Thank you!",None

It barely looked to be 6oz and it was not good at all. It was dry and the herb butter on it was disgusting. I was very disappointed this trip and it makes me not want to return since my favorite steak has been replaced with a crappy dried out alternative.

I was disappointed to hear that you are discontinuing your side dish of spinach. That is such a shame, since it is by far and away my favorite of your sides. On the recommendation of our server, I tried the green beans. Unfortunately, I found them to be inedible. The flavor was just OK but the texture was terrible. They were completely mushy. I could have made them into baby food without even needing a blender. The server brought me broccoli instead. The flavor of the broccoli was good but it was still a bit overcooked for me. I like my vegetables with a bit of crispness (I call it crisp-tender). Neither of these 2 choices had any crispness to them at all. The server apologized for the green beans and explained she had never tried them, but I thought she had said ""they're delicious"" when recommending them, so that sounded as if she HAD tried them. IT confused me.",None

12/30/2014,"I am a fairly regular customer (about 1/month) and have always been pleased with service and food. We decided to bring our family (6 adults 2 children) to the pub on December 28 at 6 p.m. to celebrate my wife's birthday.  When we ordered drinks and one of the beers didn't arrive we finally asked the waiter and he said you were out of it. He finally ordered another brand after waiting.  When we ordered the spinach salad we were told you know longer serve spinach salad due to an upcoming menu change.  It seems like you could have a couple bags of spinach on hand until the menu was changed. We were told about the menu change when we tried to order something that was taken off the menu a month or so ago.  Seems like this menu change is taking a longtime...in the meantime you are disappointing a lot of customers who order something they can't have.  Finally, service was spotty and seemed obvious you were in a scramble mode.  My family is generally very easy to please, but we came away quite unimpressed.  My wife an I will be back since we are locals and fairly regular customers and will request Heather as our server..she is always friendly and efficient.  Hopefully, we can have a more positive feeling after our next visit.  Paul H. Griffin",None

Really  3 things we ordered were out Then we ordered coffee with Baileys . and were brought something else...when we asked the waitress about it, she remained polite but was obviously mad about it, grabbed it from me after I said I would just drink this , it was ok... and returned with the same thing in a cup this time , like I am too stupid to know the difference. Then she ignored us the rest of the evening, never looking our way, even to bring us our check,... I guess she was having a bad night, but being out of food and bringing me something other than what I ordered wasn't my fault.

09/17/2014,"Service was outstanding.  Ashley is a great server; she spoke clearly and was direct and courteous. However, we are long-time customers of the restaurant and over the years we noticed the food quality and taste has its peaks and valleys.  We ordered the NY Strip steak and the Southwest burger.  My wife normally orders her steaks medium-rare, but has recently opted for higher cook temperatures due to pregnancy.  The steak, albeit medium-well, was the most flavorless item we'd ever tasted on your menu.  The steak did not appear to have any spices/seasonings on it and the amount of spinach on the plate was inadequate (about the size of a half-dollar coin).  Additionally, the cut was from the end of the loin; you know, that cut that has the large tough line running right across the center of the steak  I figured the the pub kitchen staff would use this part of the loin differently.  Maybe hand-trim these end-cuts and course grind the usable portions for use in your ""Steakburger"" rather than serve the tough-veined cut as a whole $18 steak.  The burger was ordered ""medium"" but was received completely cooked through, no pink.  To set some credibility for my wife and I, we used to work at the Olde Mill Steakhouse (currently Frank's at the Old Mill) in Fayetteville, GA, where I cooked and she served wet-aged prime steaks.  We know that purchasing these prime-grades is not usually in the cost-interest of a pub, but a flavorful steak can be achieved through a little attention to seasoning (maybe some sea salt, cracked pepper and garlic  Blackened Steak Magic with French Lavender)  We also believe that your food was at its peak when someone by the name of ""Cyrus"" was working the kitchen.",None

They did cook some fish and brought it out very quickly. He doesn't prefer the chips though and always gets fries. Whenever he orders fish and chips they always ask if he wants chips or fries. This time when the waitress/bartender said she was going to get some fish dropped for him I said something about him wanting fries and I don't think she heard me. It just wasn't asked this time and got chips and didn't want to make a fuss over it. Otherwise all was excellent and we will be back soon!,None

We had the Smoked Salmon Appetizer plate and it was delicious. The cheese spread was delicious with the salmon. My husband had the Irish Stew. He enjoyed it but I think a little more seasoning in the gravy would have made the meat flavor pop. My Irish chicken was tasty. There were lots of leeks in the cream sauce. The only improvement I would make is seasoning. It needed a pinch more salt which is hard to add after it is cooked. My experience overall was great.

06/22/2014,"As always, excellent quality food and service (Mariah did a very good job as our server). We enjoyed the usual great the pub atmosphere and outstanding value. I appreciate the fact that it is a restaurant and pub where I can bring the family. My wife and I both had the Chicken Pot Pie (my wife has ordered it twice in a row now) and the taste is truly incredible. Our server recommended the fish and chips, but in my opinion, the Chicken Pot Pie is the best tasting item on your menu. If I could offer any suggestions to improve already outstanding service; the Irish Cheese Sticks were just OK. I'd consider maybe adding a mozzarella option. Also, I'd especially take a look at the marinara dip. The taste wasn't up to Maquire's usual standards. My daughter wanted to order the ribs, but we were told that they are not available until after 6PM. It's too bad. My daughter is a big rib fan (we ordered dinner around 5:15PM). I love trying different beers, but I wouldn't order the Yeungling Summer Wheat again. I like Hefeweizen, but didn't care for the taste of Yeungling's. When the hostess showed us to our table, we asked 'if there would be any live music tonight' She said something to the effect that 'we won't be doing that anymore'. The tone of her comment was a bit more negative sounding than it needed to be. Finally, the variety of burgers on the menu is impressive, but I'd look at possibly dropping one or two of the least popular ones and replace them with a hot chicken or roast beef sandwich on the menu instead as another option. All these comments are very minor and only meant in the best positive spirit of improving on already outstanding food and service.",None

The food they brought back was very good.  We were happy that it was immediately rectified.

05/22/2014,"Love trivia night on Wednesday, and I go just about every week.  I ordered the potato leek soup yesterday, as I usually do, and it seemed a little different.  Blander.  Don't know if you had a different chef or what.  Another person who was with me ordered the barbque special, which she gets almost every week, and noticed that it appeared to taste different also.  More peppery or something.  Otherwise, everything was fine.  I'd like to see more daily specials, however, as there aren't always specials available.",None

05/21/2014,"Overall experience was good. I do however think that the presentation of the food could be greatly improved! For example, my ""just grilled"" mahi could have at least had a slice/wedge of lemon on it; a plain white piece of fish, the potatoes and some steamed broccoli on a plain plate was just VERY boring looking. Presentation sets the stage for the taste!  Thanks for listening.  :)",None
05/21/2014,"I'm a physician and essentially on call all of the time. It is so pleasant to come to a warm, and inviting restaurant as Maguires.

05/19/2014,Love the food. You can't go wrong with any meal. I had the fish and chips and hubby had the monte cristo. Both were perfect. I ordered sautéed spinach with my meal and it was cooked to perfection. Thanks for the anniversary coupon!,None

We love this place and everyone is always great to me and our family...Server Alex(sp) and Heather come to mind as always being very kind and gracious.  Alex in particular is esp. good at what he does and providing excellent service.  Maybe get the high chairs fixed  There's one with a broken strap/plastic buckle and we are lucky to seem to always get this one first and have to ask for the one with the working plastic buckle.  Other than that, keep up the good work and see you soon!",None

05/12/2014,"We came came for the Sunday brunch on 4 May. We were seated on the bar side because the tables on the other side were all occupied. Our server was the bartender (Brandon). He did a very good job of taking care of us while tending bar. I had the Irish Scramble and my wife had the breakfast sandwich. The main course was fine and arrived hot, but for some reason both our hash browns sides were cold. That was the first time we were really disappointed with our food. We like McGuires very much and plan to come again. We were very impressed when someone pointed out ""the owner's wife"". She was very busy running around with a broom and dust pan in her hand. I could tell the management was very hands on and cares very much. Thanks for the opportunity to comment. We consider Macquires ""our place"" to go. Thanks.",None

Although, the manager did remove the charge since we were not told which was great.",None

04/17/2014,"We eat at McGuire's at least every 2 weeks.  It was great food and very good service this last time.  We sat in the bar area in a booth, which we prefer and it was around 5:00 pm.  My husband likes IPA beers and usually asks for a sample before he makes a decision.  This visit he did get a sample, but we got the impression from the bartender that they do not really care to do that!  The time before the waiter suggested the sampler of beers but we do not want to do that. He usually gets a couple of beers and likes tasting recommendations from the waiter.  If anything I would request you add more craft IPA's to the menu for my husband's sake.",None

Others could use a little extra study time. Food is always good And the homemade mustard is the bomb!",None
